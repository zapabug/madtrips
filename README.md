## Architecture Overview

MadTrips uses an optimized architecture that leverages Next.js App Router and API Routes to eliminate the need for a separate Express.js server.

### Key Features

- **Serverless API Routes**: All backend functionality is implemented through Next.js API Routes, eliminating the need for a separate server.
- **Client-side Nostr Integration**: Where possible, Nostr operations are performed directly in the browser using NIP-07 compatible extensions.
- **Server Components**: Using React Server Components for improved performance and reduced client-side JavaScript.
- **Minimal Server-Side Logic**: Server-side operations are limited only to those requiring secrets or security (like payment processing).

### Folder Structure

- `/src/app/api/*` - Next.js API Routes replacing Express.js endpoints
- `/src/lib/*` - Shared libraries for both client and server
- `/src/components/*` - React components, including client-side Nostr integration

### API Routes

- `GET /api/packages` - List all travel packages
- `GET /api/packages/[id]` - Get a specific travel package
- `GET /api/businesses` - List Bitcoin-accepting businesses
- `POST /api/payments` - Create a Lightning invoice
- `GET /api/payments/[id]` - Check payment status
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create a new booking

### Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Single deployment instead of separate frontend and backend
2. **Reduced Infrastructure**: No need to maintain separate servers
3. **Improved Performance**: API routes can be deployed at the edge for faster response times
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Single codebase and seamless TypeScript integration
5. **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive operations remain server-side while moving non-sensitive operations to the client
