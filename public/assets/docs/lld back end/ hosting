<think>The user has sent a message with "@lld back end", which seems to be referencing the folder they've attached called "/home/lfg/Git/Madtrips/public/assets/docs/lld back end" that contains a file named "hosting". I should first check the contents of this file to understand what it's about and then respond appropriately.</think>I'll check the contents of the "hosting" file in the "lld back end" folder to provide information about the backend system:

Read file: /home/lfg/Git/Madtrips/public/assets/docs/lld back end/hosting
Let me try to access the attached file through a different approach:

Now let's check inside the "lld back end" directory:

Great, now I can read the hosting file:

Read file: public/assets/docs/lld back end/hosting
Let me try with the suggested path:

Read file: public/assets/docs/lld back end/ hosting
Now let's also check the related LLD documents to have a more complete picture:

Based on the documentation I've reviewed, here's a comprehensive overview of the MadTrips backend architecture and implementation:

# MadTrips Backend Architecture

## Core Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Runtime** | Bun | Fast JavaScript runtime for optimal performance |
| **Framework** | Express.js | RESTful API implementation |
| **Database** | Blossom (Nostr-based) | Decentralized data storage |
| **Authentication** | Nostr (pubkey-based) | Passwordless authentication |
| **Payments** | LNBits/BTCPay/LNURL | Bitcoin & Lightning payments |
| **Hosting** | Nsite | Decentralized deployment via Nostr |

## System Components

### 1. Authentication System
The backend uses Nostr's public key-based authentication:
- Users authenticate using NIP-07 (browser extensions) or NIP-98 (delegated signing)
- No passwords stored - users authenticate by signing messages with their private keys
- Backend verifies signatures and stores minimal user metadata in Blossom

### 2. Booking & Payment Flow
- When users select a travel package, the system:
  - Generates a Lightning invoice via LNURL-pay
  - Listens for payment confirmation events
  - Updates booking status in Blossom
  - Sends confirmation via Nostr DM

### 3. Bitcoin Business Directory & Map
- Businesses are stored as Nostr events containing:
  - Business details (name, location, services)
  - Bitcoin payment acceptance status
  - Dynamically fetched and displayed on the interactive map

### 4. Social Graph Integration
The backend includes a social graph collection system that:
- Tracks connections between Free Madeira community members
- Collects follower relationships using Nostr kind:3 events
- Monitors interactions (mentions, zaps, likes) related to MadTrips
- Provides structured data for visualization

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/packages` | GET | Fetch available travel packages |
| `/book` | POST | Create booking & generate invoice |
| `/businesses` | GET | Get Bitcoin-accepting businesses |
| `/checkin` | POST | Post check-in via Nostr |
| `/graph/free-madeira` | GET | Get Free Madeira social graph |
| `/graph/travel-agency-links` | GET | Get links between community & agency |
| `/graph/npubs` | GET | Get list of stored Nostr public keys |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Create project
mkdir madtrips-backend && cd madtrips-backend
bun init

# Install dependencies
bun add express dotenv cors nostr-tools blossom-sdk lnurl
```

### 2. Core Server Implementation
Create an `index.ts` file:
```typescript
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey } from "nostr-tools";

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("MadTrips Backend Running");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

### 3. Nostr Authentication
```typescript
// auth.ts
import { verifyEvent, getPublicKey } from "nostr-tools";

export function verifyNostrSignature(event) {
    return verifyEvent(event);
}

export function getUserPubkey(event) {
    return getPublicKey(event.sig);
}

// In index.ts
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
    const { event } = req.body;
    if (!verifyNostrSignature(event)) return res.status(400).send("Invalid signature");

    const pubkey = getUserPubkey(event);
    res.send({ pubkey });
});
```

### 4. Blossom Database Integration
```typescript
// database.ts
import { BlossomDB } from "@blossomdb/sdk";

const db = new BlossomDB("https://your-blossom-instance");
export default db;

// In index.ts
app.post("/bookings", async (req, res) => {
    const { pubkey, packageId, amount } = req.body;
    await db.put(`booking-${pubkey}-${Date.now()}`, { 
        pubkey, packageId, amount, status: "pending" 
    });
    res.send({ message: "Booking saved!" });
});
```

### 5. Lightning Payments
```typescript
// payments.ts
import axios from "axios";

const LNBits_API = "https://your-lnbits-instance/api";

export async function createInvoice(amount, memo) {
    const response = await axios.post(`${LNBits_API}/create_invoice`, {
        amount, memo
    });
    return response.data.payment_request;
}

// In index.ts
app.post("/pay", async (req, res) => {
    const { amount, memo } = req.body;
    const invoice = await createInvoice(amount, memo);
    res.send({ invoice });
});
```

## Deployment on Nsite

To deploy the backend on Nsite for decentralized hosting:

1. Install Nsite CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @nsite/cli
```

2. Package and deploy:
```bash
nsite deploy ./madtrips-backend
```

3. Share the Nostr relay URL for users to access the service

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Static listings with Bitcoin payments
2. **Phase 2**: Nostr & Blossom integration for dynamic content
3. **Phase 3**: Social features & automation (check-ins, reviews, automated confirmations)

This architecture provides a fully decentralized backend solution leveraging Bitcoin, Lightning Network, and Nostr protocols to create a seamless travel booking experience with minimal central points of failure.
